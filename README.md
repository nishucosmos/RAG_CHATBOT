#RAG-Powered Q&A Chatbot


This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that allows you to upload PDFs and ask questions about them. It combines document retrieval with a large language model to provide accurate, context-aware answers. The system uses FAISS for vector search, Hugging Face embeddings for semantic understanding, and Flan-T5 as the language model. A simple Streamlit interface makes it easy to use, and the model can optionally be deployed to AWS SageMaker for scalable inference.
